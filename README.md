# Hydraulic Property Estimator - Rating Curves for Regular and/or Irregular Cross-Sections
Model for estimation of Hydraulic Properties and Rating Curves in Regular and/or Irregular Cross-Sections

Welcome to Hydraulic_Property_Algorithm_V3

This algorithm estimate several important hydraulic properties for 
regular and irregular cross-sections
Using data from a .csv file and matlab, we can derive values of
- Area, Perimeter, Hydraulic Radius
- Section factor, Conveyance, and ultimately Normal Flow


How to Install and Run the Model?
- Please, create a folder in you machine. Unzip the files in this folder. 
- Open the .CSV file and change cross-section data (instructions in the csv file)
- Open the main algorithm in matlab and click in Run inside of matlab
Note: Several automatic graphs will be generated, so please make sure to close 
them before running the model again

How to Use the Model?
- You can use it to determine rating curves in river or even in man-made channels. 
- You just have to enter the cross-section coordinates, stage-roughness curve, 
and bottom slope
